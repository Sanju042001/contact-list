# contact-list
The contact list code is done by importing tkinter and in this using tkinter we have add,search,display,delete.
In this we can add contacts and search the contact that we want and in deleting,by typing single letter it shows the contact and you can delete it.
By cancelling the tkinter box it does not delete the contacts that you have saved.
In display the contacts can be seen that you have saved.
